spring-websockets-sample
========================

This project has two subfolders deck/ and projects/

the deck is a reveal.js presentation, so just clone the project and open up the deck/index.html file and you should see the presentation come up cleanly.

Each of the samples within the project/ folder has a README.md file with instruction on how to start up the application.
